RSS-GLib is a wrapper around the fantastic libmrss library for parsing
rss, atom, and other syndications.  The reason for this was two-fold.
The libmrss, while quite powerful, is a little more complex than needed
for most projects.  For this reason RSS-GLib aims to wrap that into a
simpler API.  The primary reason, however, is that gobject is so easy
to wrap into various languages.

Dependencies:

	glib-2.0 (probably 2.15 or higher)
	libmrss0

Python example:

	>>> import rss
	>>> parser = rss.Parser()
	>>> parser.load_from_file('/tmp/atom.xml')
	True
	>>> # SEE ALSO: parser.load_from_data("...")
	>>> doc = parser.get_document()
	>>> for item in doc.get_items(): print item.props.title
